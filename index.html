                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The Glorious Revolution was a pivotal event in English history, occurring from 1688 to 1689. It involved the overthrow of Catholic King James II by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau. This relatively bloodless coup was a direct response to James II's attempts to assert royal absolutism and promote Catholicism, which threatened the Protestant establishment and parliamentary power. The revolution ultimately established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown, fundamentally altering the balance of power in England.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Key figures include King James II, whose policies sparked the crisis; William of Orange and his wife Mary II (James II's Protestant daughter), who were invited by Parliament to take the throne; and influential Parliamentarians such as the Earl of Danby, who played a crucial role in orchestrating the invitation to William.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The Glorious Revolution had profound and lasting impacts. It firmly established the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, meaning Parliament's laws were supreme and the monarch ruled by consent, not divine right. This led directly to the English Bill of Rights (1689), which guaranteed certain rights to citizens and further limited royal power. It also influenced political thought on limited government and individual liberties across Europe and America, serving as a significant precursor to later revolutionary movements.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The American Revolution was a transformative political upheaval that took place in the latter half of the 18th century, from 1775 to 1783. It saw thirteen British colonies in North America unite to break free from the British Empire, ultimately forming the independent United States of America. Fueled by Enlightenment ideals and growing resentment over British taxation without representation, the conflict escalated from protests to armed struggle, culminating in a decisive victory for the colonists.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Prominent figures include George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and first U.S. President; Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence; Benjamin Franklin, a key diplomat and statesman; and John Adams, a leading advocate for independence and second U.S. President. European figures like Marquis de Lafayette and Baron von Steuben also played significant roles.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The American Revolution led to the independence of the United States, establishing the first modern republic based on democratic principles and popular sovereignty. It inspired numerous independence movements and democratic reforms worldwide, particularly in Latin America and France. However, its ideals of liberty were profoundly contradicted by the continued institution of slavery, highlighting a major paradox at the nation's founding that would lead to future conflicts.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799. It marked a dramatic shift from an absolute monarchy and feudal system to a republic, though it was characterized by immense violence, political instability, and successive changes in government. The revolution began with the storming of the Bastille and progressed through various phases, including the Reign of Terror, before culminating in the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">Key figures include Maximilien Robespierre, a leading figure of the Jacobins and the architect of the Reign of Terror; King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, whose executions symbolized the end of the monarchy; and later, Napoleon Bonaparte, who rose to power during the revolution's final stages and transformed France into an empire.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The French Revolution profoundly impacted French and modern history. It abolished feudalism, dismantled the monarchy, and introduced concepts of popular sovereignty, citizenship, and universal rights (though initially limited). It inspired nationalist movements and democratic reforms across Europe and the world, spreading ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Despite its violent excesses and eventual return to authoritarian rule under Napoleon, its legacy of radical change and its influence on political thought are undeniable.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The Haitian Revolution, spanning from 1791 to 1804, was a monumental and unprecedented event: a successful insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti). It was the only slave revolt in history to result in the founding of a state, marking a definitive victory against both slavery and European colonialism. The revolution was marked by fierce fighting, complex political maneuvering, and the unwavering determination of the enslaved population.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The most prominent figure was Toussaint Louverture, a brilliant military strategist and political leader who rose from slavery to lead the revolution. Other key figures include Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Louverture's successor and Haiti's first emperor; and Henri Christophe, another important general who later became king of northern Haiti.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The Haitian Revolution achieved complete abolition of slavery and colonial rule, establishing Haiti as the first independent black republic in the world and the second independent nation in the Americas. This had a profound global impact, serving as a beacon of hope for enslaved people worldwide and a terrifying warning to slave-owning powers. It forced a re-evaluation of the Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality, exposing the hypocrisy of nations that championed freedom while maintaining slavery. Despite its triumph, Haiti faced severe international isolation and economic hardship for generations due to punitive reparations demanded by France and a global embargo by slave-owning nations.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Historians vigorously debate whether the concept of "freedom" has remained constant or evolved significantly since the Age of Revolutions.
                        Initially, "freedom" often referred primarily to political liberty from monarchical or imperial control, and the specific rights of property-owning men to participate in governance.
                        However, the very act of revolution, especially the radical actions of the Haitian Revolution, pushed the boundaries of this definition.
                        Over time, the concept expanded to include freedom from chattel slavery, civil rights for all citizens regardless of race or gender, economic justice, and broader social equality.
                        This ongoing evolution highlights the dynamic nature of human rights and the continuous struggle to realize universal ideals.

                        "Freedom, in its modern sense, is less about the absence of restraint and more about the presence of opportunity and the recognition of inherent dignity for all. It's a journey, not a static destination." - Dr. Anya Sharma, Contemporary Historian.

                        The success of these revolutions is a complex and often debated topic, as their outcomes varied greatly and often fell short of their initial, lofty ideals.
                        The Glorious Revolution largely succeeded in establishing parliamentary supremacy and a constitutional monarchy in England, setting a precedent for limited government.
                        The American Revolution achieved independence and established a republic, but its foundational ideals of liberty were deeply contradicted by the persistence of slavery for another 80 years.
                        The French Revolution, while initially aiming for liberty and equality, devolved into the brutal Reign of Terror and ultimately led to Napoleon's authoritarian rule, though its ideals profoundly influenced subsequent movements across Europe.
                        The Haitian Revolution achieved complete independence and the abolition of slavery, a monumental success against overwhelming odds, but faced severe international isolation and economic hardship for generations.
                        Thus, "success" is often measured not just by immediate outcomes, but by long-term impact on global political thought and subsequent struggles for liberation.
